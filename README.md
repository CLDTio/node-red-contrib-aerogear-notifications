# node-red node for Push Notifications through Aerogear Unified Push Server
Initial commits for a node-red node to send push notifications to devices through AeroGear Unified Push Server.

# Usage

## As a node-red node
***NOTE: In the making***
The module will be (eventually) published to npm, but it's nowhere near ready.

Updates coming soon.

## As a standalone module
Running standalone is not the purpose of this module (you should use the Aerogear module instead!). If you are curious about development, you can run the module from terminal with:

    node lib/aerogear.js

**Note:** You will need to add *url* *api_key* and *secret* to that file. To do so, you'll need to install UPS (locally or through OpenShift Online) and create an app.

# TODOs

  [] create the node-red html front
    [] decide on inputs and how to handle config file
  [] investigate packaging and publication to npm
